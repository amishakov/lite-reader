GOAL
----
The whole plan is building a RIA feed aggregator,

What did I use?
---------------
pdo and LiteDO,
a modified version of Green framework,
jQuery, and I used object-literal concept to organize js codes


INSTALL
--------
1. clone/download the whole project
2. make app/db/agg.db writable for webserver
3. create a folder in "public" folder, name it cache, and make it writable for webserver
4. that's it, enjoy a very lite and minimal feed aggregator: the lite-reader
